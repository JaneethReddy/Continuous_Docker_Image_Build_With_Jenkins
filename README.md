<h3> •	I have first used the DockerFile to write all the required details which are needed to build our required image. <br>
•	You can also check that image at Docker Hub as I pushed my image to this repository. <br>
•	Then I have written the Deployment.yaml file & service.yaml file to deploy my container image into Kubernetes cluster as asked by you. <br>
•	I have used Gcloud Kubernetes cluster to test my deployment files. You can also refer my screenshots to see confirm that I have deployed all of them correctly. <br>
•	Then finally to continuously Build my docker image I have created a Jenkins pipeline script. <br>
